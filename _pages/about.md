Hi there! My name is Antonio Tejero-de-Pablos, and I am a researcher in computer vision. In particular, I am interested in learning from multidomain-multimodal data. That is, data from different modalities (visual, audio, text, etc.) that comes from different sources (advertisement, comics, medical, etc.). This is a very complex and challenging problem in computer vision, which motivates me to follow this line of research.

I currently work at the [Cyber Agent's AI Lab](https://cyberagent.ai/ailab/people/a_tejero/), as a member of the Media Fundamentals Team.
