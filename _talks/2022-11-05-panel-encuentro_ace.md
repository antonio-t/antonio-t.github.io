On November 2022, the III Gathering of Spanish researchers in Japan (ACE Japon) took place at the Embassy. It was my honor to moderate a panel discussion with researchers belonging to "industrial" and "academic" institutions. We discussed the advantages/disadvantages and different perspectives on how each panelist conduct their research. It may be complicated, but in the future a hybrid environment between both worlds would be desirable.
