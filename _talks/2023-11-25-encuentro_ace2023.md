On November 2023, the IV Gathering of Spanish researchers in Japan (ACE Japon) took place at the Embassy of Spain in Tokyo. It was my honor to participate in a panel discussion with researchers with experience in doing collaborative research between Spain and Japan. We discussed the progress and TO DOs in collaborative research, as well as future ideas to involve students and women into STEM. Later, I introduced my research in heterogeneous data learning, including an explanation on the differences between research and product.
