The Cervantes Institute in Tokyo is an organization to promote Spanish culture in Japan, and Spanish-Japanese collaborations. In this event, I presented some basic concepts about artificial intelligence (AI), and my experience in Spain and Japan as a researcher in AI. Then, I moderated a panel discussion along with Dr. Fernando Casta√±o Romero and Dr. Yoshitaka Ushiku, regarding how AI is present within society in Spain and Japan respectively.
