CCSE2023, CyberAgent AI Lab's research conference for companies, was a success! I help facilitating collaboration talks among companies and the keynote speech. In particular, I had the honor of participating in a panel discussion about the significance of R&D organization in companies, among CyberAgent-Cygames-Panasonic. For the keynote speech, Jerry Chi, the representative of Stability AI Japan, gave a presentation on the state of the art in generative AI with text, image, audio, code, etc. I feel we managed to create a wonderful place for exchanging ideas and making new contacts.
