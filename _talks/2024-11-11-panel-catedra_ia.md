Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in current society, generating a multifaceted impact spanning from economics to culture. In an increasingly digitalized world, AI has been integrated into a variety of sectors, from healthcare to entertainment, redefining the way we interact, work and relate. However, along with its promises of efficiency and convenience, AI also poses a number of ethical, social and economic challenges that require careful reflection and informed debate. In this context, we will explore the current effect of artificial intelligence on society and its implications on our future. The symposium conducted on November 11th featured presentations by invited experts from Spain and Japan, a panel discussion and poster sessions by local researchers.
