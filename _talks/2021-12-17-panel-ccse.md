CCSE (Conference on Computer Science for Enterprise) is conference organized by the company CyberAgent. It is a place for company researchers to share their latest advances with their peers from other companies. I moderated and participated in a panel discussion about how non-Japanese researchers can pursue different types of career paths in Japan.
