Traditional image recognition methods only consider objects belonging to already learned classes. However, since training a recognition model with every object class in the world is unfeasible, a way of getting information on unknown objects (i.e., objects whose class has not been learned) is necessary. A way for an image recognition system to learn new classes could be asking a human about objects that are unknown. In this paper, we propose a method for generating questions about unknown objects in an image, as means to get information about classes that have not been learned. Our method consists of a module for proposing objects, a module for identifying unknown objects, and a module for generating questions about unknown objects. The experimental results via human evaluation show that our method can successfully get information about unknown objects in an image dataset. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/mil-tokyo/vqg-unknown.
