In this paper we introduce, to the best of our knowledge, the first adaptation of the Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network for its execution on a GPU, together with a self-designed neural network based on ART models called SOON. The full VisTex database, containing 167 texture images, is proved to be classified in a very short time using these GPU-based neural networks. The Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network implemented on the GPU performs up to ×100 times faster than the equivalent CPU version, while the SOON neural network is speeded-up by ×70 times. Also, using the same texture patterns the Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network obtains a success rate of 48% and SOON of 82% for texture classification.
