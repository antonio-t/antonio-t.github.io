E-Health systems are experiencing an impulse in these last years, when many medical agencies began to include digital solutions into their platforms. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are one of the most important improvements, being in its most part a patient-oriented tool. To achieve a completely operational EHR platform, security and privacy problems have to be resolved, due to the importance of the data included within these records. But given all the different methods to address security and privacy, they still remain in most cases as an open issue. This paper studies existing and proposed solutions included in different scenarios, in order to offer an overview of the current state in EHR systems. Bibliographic material has been obtained mainly from MEDLINE and SCOPUS sources, and over 30 publications have been analyzed. Many EHR platforms are being developed, but most of them present weaknesses when they are opened to the public. These architectures gain significance when they cover all the requisites related to security and privacy.
