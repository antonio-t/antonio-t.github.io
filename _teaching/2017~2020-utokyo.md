While working as a researcher at the Machine Intelligence Lab (U-Tokyo), I was in charge of basic lab management tasks (e.g., lab tours), as well as assisting the students in their research tasks (e.g., topic selection, paper writing). I was also assigned leader duties for a medical project, and during the lab's participation at the RoboCup competition.
