I was the lecturer in a workshop about AI organized by IEEE Young Professionals. In the morning, the students were given an intensive lecture on AI and machine learning in order to learn the basics and the applications. Then, during the afternoon, the students thought about innovative applications using AI and created their own idea proposal. Finally, the most interesting idea received an award.
