I completed a course taught at the University of Tokyo about "learning how to teach at a higher education institution". The University of Tokyo Future Faculty Program (UTokyo FFP) is a course aimed to enhance teaching and research skills of graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty members at the University of Tokyo. The contents range from class/syllabus design to student evaluation, and include practical teaching sessions.
