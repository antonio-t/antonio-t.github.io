In collaboration with the Center for Research and Development, we spent a semester creating a mentoring event aimed to supporting the international students of the University of Tokyo. By using active learning and other team working techniques, we were able to:
1. Share experiences among non-Japanese people living in the country
2. Bring to light the worries and problems of the international students
3. Propose ideas to solve those problems, including a poster presentation
