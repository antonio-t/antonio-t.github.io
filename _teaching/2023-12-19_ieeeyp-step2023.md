As a representative of CyberAgent AI Lab, I presented our research to 25 university students in a company visit organized by IEEE Young Professionals. We introduced the students (coming from U-Tokyo, Tokyo Tech, etc.) our research in computer vision, audio and a brief explanation of the working system at the AI lab.
