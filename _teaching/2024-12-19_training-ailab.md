I was the lecturer in CyberAgent AI Lab's research skill-up training. I was in charge of the lecture about "how to write research papers". Following the method of the textbook "Science Research Writing (2nd Ed.) by Hilary Glasman-Deal", I presented several tips and advice by using real examples of a famous research paper. Between sections, the participants had som hands-on time to analyze a paper of their choice, and ask questions.
