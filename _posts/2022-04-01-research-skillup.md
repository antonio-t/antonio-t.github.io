At CyberAgent AI lab, researchers have the chance to create seminars in which members would gather to carry out activities related to their job and improve their skills. After I entered the company, I decided to start a new seminar: the "research skill-up" seminar. The goal of this seminar is to polish our paper writing, research productivity and other management skills. Each session, each member would gather information about a topic of their interest and present it to the other members. In this blog post, I talk about one of the main topics discussed in the seminar: How to write scientific papers.
